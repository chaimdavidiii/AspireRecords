# AspireRecords
Term 2 Project at Aspire2International

This is my second term project at Aspire2International. It is a windows app for a record store.

Functions:

* Login
* ADD/EDIT/DELETE user accounts
* ADD/EDIT/DELETE records for sale
* ADD/EDIT stock of each record for sale
* VIEW/SEARCH through past transactions
* POS with CART using data tables.
* CASHIER to calculate change.

This project was made possible by countless hours of piecing together code taken from tutorials, stackoverflow, and other sources.
